       				<p style="font-size: 16px;" class="paragraph2">Looking back at my first drawings, I often chose to scratch geometric houses from waxy crayons and single hair stranded stick people representing my family because it was where I came from. Yet my inspiration as an artist today does not fall far. I am inspired to pay homage to the concept of Origins – the derivation or commencement of an existence. My artwork also features an infusion of my cultural and self-developmental origins, being that they significantly influence my paradigm of existence and interpretation. In the curation of my portfolio, I strive to deliver a mixture of appreciating stylistic form and conceptual ideas in the exploration of impactfully retelling the story my chosen subject.</p>
       				<!-- <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="paragraph2">As a media executive on team, designing the campaign for this case competition was an incredible creative roller coaster. The case competition was one of PBSN's largest first semester events. Our media team was tasked with:

                        <li>Creating media assets and marketing initiatives which focus on selling the scale and calibre of the case competition rather than convincing students to attend</li>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="paragraph2">When prompted with the statement: shiny, the theme of packaging and the thought of all things new, immediately came to mind. I specifically chose to focus on plastic material and ways to represent the material in an abstracted way. I wanted to present the subject such that the object and its reflective shadow practically becomes unidentifiable. This method of representation removes the common associations of everyday waste objects and challenges the viewers to search and interpret the material. The photographs focus on the concept that we live in a world of material waste. Our eyes are accustomed to packaging and plastic waste as it’s intently engrained into our everyday lifestyles. Through altering what we perceive as familiar, this photographic investigation challenges the viewers to re-evaluate disposable plastic waste.
                    The choice of presenting the photographs on a clear material, aligns with the thematic association of plastic and creates a mechanism for light to traverse through the highlights of the photo. It creates an interesting interaction between the subject and natural light. It highlights the photographed subject, drawing the viewers attention to the more intricate details of the print. Above all, the choice of the medium creates an interesting texture and dimension to the photos which crafts an interesting way of presenting and re-interpreting material plastic waste. Single use plastic is a decision rather than a lifestyle and it’s valuable to consider as an individual the changes you can make to contribute to an accumulative difference.

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="paragraph2"> After being introduced to Candy Jernigan’s eerie assemblage piece: found dope, I was inspired to create an evidence board of Sylvia Plath’s suicide. Sylvia Plath was a well-known poet who suffered from maniac depression and bi-polar disorder after her dad died when she was 8 years old. Through this piece, I hoped to pay homage to her incredible work through prolonging her short-lived legacy. I essentially retold her life story through objects that would symbolise monumental moments of her. For instance, I nailed a ring on the board to represent her marriage to Ted Hughes. My 6-word story for this piece is “Words Heard Accidently Over the Phone”. Plath fell into the deepest of her depression when she found out that her husband was cheating on her through an accidently phone call.</p>
